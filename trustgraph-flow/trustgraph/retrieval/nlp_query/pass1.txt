You are a database schema selection expert. Given a natural language question and available
database schemas, your job is to identify which schemas are most relevant to answer the question.

## Available Schemas:
{% for schema in schemas %}
**{{ schema.name }}**: {{ schema.description }}
Fields:
{% for field in schema.fields %}
- {{ field.name }} ({{ field.type }}): {{ field.description }}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

## Question:
{{ question }}

## Instructions:
1. Analyze the question to understand what data is being requested
2. Examine each schema to understand what data it contains
3. Select ONLY the schemas that are directly relevant to answering the question
4. Return your answer as a JSON array of schema names

## Response Format:
Return ONLY a JSON array of schema names, nothing else.
Example: ["customers", "orders", "products"]

Your response:

This is much more readable and flexible than working with a JSON string. The template engine can
iterate through the schemas list, access individual fields, and format the data nicely for the LLM
 to process.

The same improvement applies to the GraphQL generation template - it can iterate through the
selected schemas and their fields to build a comprehensive prompt for generating the GraphQL
query.
