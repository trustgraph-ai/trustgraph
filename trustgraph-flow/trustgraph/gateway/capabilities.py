"""
Gateway-side authorisation entry points.

Under the IAM contract (see docs/tech-specs/iam-contract.md) the
gateway holds *no* policy state.  Roles, capability sets, and
workspace-scope rules all live in the IAM regime (iam-svc for OSS).
This module is the thin surface the gateway uses to ask the regime
for a decision:

- ``PUBLIC`` / ``AUTHENTICATED`` sentinels for endpoints that don't
  go through capability-based authorisation.
- :func:`enforce` — authenticate-only, then ask the regime.
- :func:`enforce_workspace` — default-fill the workspace from the
  caller's bound workspace and ask the regime, with the workspace
  treated as the resource address.

The capability strings themselves are an open vocabulary — see
docs/tech-specs/capabilities.md.  The gateway does not validate them
beyond passing them through; an unknown capability simply produces a
deny verdict from the regime.
