  summary: Embeddings - text to vector conversion
  description: |
    Convert text to embedding vectors for semantic similarity search.

    ## Embeddings Overview

    Embeddings transform text into dense vector representations that:
    - Capture semantic meaning
    - Enable similarity comparisons via cosine distance
    - Support semantic search and retrieval
    - Power RAG systems

    ## Use Cases

    - **Document indexing**: Convert documents to vectors for storage
    - **Query encoding**: Convert search queries for similarity matching
    - **Semantic similarity**: Find related texts via vector distance
    - **Clustering**: Group similar content
    - **Classification**: Use as features for ML models

    ## Vector Dimensions

    Dimension count depends on embedding model:
    - text-embedding-ada-002: 1536 dimensions
    - text-embedding-3-small: 1536 dimensions
    - text-embedding-3-large: 3072 dimensions
    - Custom models: Varies

    ## Single Request

    Unlike batch embedding APIs, this endpoint processes one text at a time.
    For bulk operations, use document-load or text-load services.

                Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks.
                They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.
                Through training, they learn to recognize patterns and make predictions.
