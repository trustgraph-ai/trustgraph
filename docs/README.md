### üöÄ [Quick Start Guide](README.quickstart-docker-compose.md)
Step-by-step guide to get TrustGraph running using Docker Compose. Perfect for first-time users who want to quickly deploy and test TrustGraph.

## Getting Started

If you're new to TrustGraph, we recommend starting with the
[Compose - Quick Start Guide](README.quickstart-docker-compose.md)
to get a working system up and running quickly.

For developers integrating TrustGraph into applications, check out the
[API Documentation](apis/README.md) to understand the available interfaces.

For system administrators and power users, the
[CLI Documentation](cli/README.md) provides detailed information about all
command-line tools.

## Ways to deploy

If you haven't deployed TrustGraph before, the 'compose' deployment 
mentioned above is going to be the least commitment of setting things up:
See [Quick Start Guide](README.quickstart-docker-compose.md)

Other deployment mechanisms include:
- [Scaleway Kubernetes deployment using Pulumi](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/pulumi-trustgraph-scaleway)
- [Intel Gaudi and GPU](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph-tiber-cloud) - tested on Intel Tiber cloud
- [Azure Kubernetes deployment using Pulumi](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/pulumi-trustgraph-aks)
- [AWS EC2 single instance deployment using Pulumi](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/pulumi-trustgraph-ec2)
- [GCP GKE cloud deployment using Pulumi](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/pulumi-trustgraph-gke)
- [RKE Kubernetes on AWS deployment using Pulumi](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/pulumi-trustgraph-aws-rke)
- It should be possible to deploy on AWS EKS, but we haven't been able to
  script anything reliable so far.
