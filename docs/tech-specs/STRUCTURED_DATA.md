# Structured Data Technical Specification

## Overview

This specification describes the integration of TrustGraph with structured data flows, enabling the system to work with data that can be represented as rows in tables or objects in object stores. The integration supports four primary use cases:

1. **Unstructured to Structured Extraction**: Read unstructured data sources, identify and extract object structures, and store them in a tabular format
2. **Structured Data Ingestion**: Load data that is already in structured formats directly into the structured store alongside extracted data
3. **Natural Language Querying**: Convert natural language questions into structured queries to extract matching data from the store
4. **Direct Structured Querying**: Execute structured queries directly against the data store for precise data retrieval
