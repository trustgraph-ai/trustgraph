# Knowledge Graph Architecture Foundations

## Foundation 1: Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) Graph Model
**Decision**: Adopt SPO/RDF as the core knowledge representation model

**Rationale**:
- Provides maximum flexibility and interoperability with existing graph technologies
- Enables seamless translation to other graph query languages (e.g., SPO → Cypher, but not vice versa)
- Creates a foundation that "unlocks a lot" of downstream capabilities
- Supports both node-to-node relationships (SPO) and node-to-literal relationships (RDF)

**Implementation**: 
- Core data structure: `node → edge → {node | literal}`
- Maintain compatibility with RDF standards while supporting extended SPO operations

## Foundation 2: LLM-Native Knowledge Graph Integration
**Decision**: Optimize knowledge graph structure and operations for LLM interaction

**Rationale**:
- Primary use case involves LLMs interfacing with knowledge graphs
- Graph technology choices must prioritize LLM compatibility over other considerations
- Enables natural language processing workflows that leverage structured knowledge

**Implementation**:
- Design graph schemas that LLMs can effectively reason about
- Optimize for common LLM interaction patterns

## Foundation 3: Embedding-Based Graph Navigation
**Decision**: Implement direct mapping from natural language queries to graph nodes via embeddings

**Rationale**:
- Enables the simplest possible path from NLP query to graph navigation
- Avoids complex intermediate query generation steps
- Provides efficient semantic search capabilities within the graph structure

**Implementation**:
- `NLP Query → Graph Embeddings → Graph Nodes`
- Maintain embedding representations for all graph entities
- Support direct semantic similarity matching for query resolution

## Foundation 4: Distributed Entity Resolution with Deterministic Identifiers
**Decision**: Support parallel knowledge extraction with deterministic entity identification (80% rule)

**Rationale**:
- **Ideal**: Single-process extraction with complete state visibility enables perfect entity resolution
- **Reality**: Scalability requirements demand parallel processing capabilities
- **Compromise**: Design for deterministic entity identification across distributed processes

**Implementation**:
- Develop mechanisms for generating consistent, unique identifiers across different knowledge extractors
- Same entity mentioned in different processes must resolve to the same identifier
- Acknowledge that ~20% of edge cases may require alternative processing models
- Design fallback mechanisms for complex entity resolution scenarios

## Foundation 5: Event-Driven Architecture with Publish-Subscribe
**Decision**: Implement pub-sub messaging system for system coordination

**Rationale**:
- Enables loose coupling between knowledge extraction, storage, and query components
- Supports real-time updates and notifications across the system
- Facilitates scalable, distributed processing workflows

**Implementation**:
- Message-driven coordination between system components
- Event streams for knowledge updates, extraction completion, and query results

## Foundation 6: Reentrant Agent Communication
**Decision**: Support reentrant pub-sub operations for agent-based processing

**Rationale**:
- Enables sophisticated agent workflows where agents can trigger and respond to each other
- Supports complex, multi-step knowledge processing pipelines
- Allows for recursive and iterative processing patterns

**Implementation**:
- Pub-sub system must handle reentrant calls safely
- Agent coordination mechanisms that prevent infinite loops
- Support for agent workflow orchestration

## Foundation 7: Columnar Data Store Integration
**Decision**: Ensure query compatibility with columnar storage systems

**Rationale**:
- Enables efficient analytical queries over large knowledge datasets
- Supports business intelligence and reporting use cases
- Bridges graph-based knowledge representation with traditional analytical workflows

**Implementation**:
- Query translation layer: Graph queries → Columnar queries
- Hybrid storage strategy supporting both graph operations and analytical workloads
- Maintain query performance across both paradigms
