# TrustGraph Flow API

This API provides workflow management for TrustGraph components. It manages flow classes 
(workflow templates) and flow instances (active running workflows) that orchestrate 
complex data processing pipelines.

## Request/response

### Request

The request contains the following fields:
- `operation`: The operation to perform (see operations below)
- `class_name`: Flow class name (for class operations and start-flow)
- `class_definition`: Flow class definition JSON (for put-class)
- `description`: Flow description (for start-flow)
- `flow_id`: Flow instance ID (for flow instance operations)

### Response

The response contains the following fields:
- `class_names`: Array of flow class names (returned by list-classes)
- `flow_ids`: Array of active flow IDs (returned by list-flows)
- `class_definition`: Flow class definition JSON (returned by get-class)
- `flow`: Flow instance JSON (returned by get-flow)
- `description`: Flow description (returned by get-flow)
- `error`: Error information if operation fails

## REST service

The REST service is available at `/api/v1/flow` and accepts the above request formats.

## Websocket

Requests have a `request` object containing the operation fields.
Responses have a `response` object containing the response fields.

Request:
```json
{
    "id": "unique-request-id",
    "service": "flow",
    "request": {
        "operation": "list-classes"
    }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "id": "unique-request-id",
    "response": {
        "class_names": ["pdf-processor", "text-analyzer"]
    },
    "complete": true
}
```

## Pulsar

The Pulsar schema for the Flow API is defined in Python code here:

https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph/blob/master/trustgraph-base/trustgraph/schema/flows.py

Default request queue:
`non-persistent://tg/request/flow`

Default response queue:
`non-persistent://tg/response/flow`

Request schema:
`trustgraph.schema.FlowRequest`

Response schema:
`trustgraph.schema.FlowResponse`

## Python SDK

The Python SDK provides convenient access to the Flow API:

```python
from trustgraph.api.flow import FlowClient

client = FlowClient()

# List all flow classes
classes = await client.list_classes()

# Get a flow class definition
definition = await client.get_class("pdf-processor")

# Start a flow instance
await client.start_flow("pdf-processor", "flow-123", "Processing batch 1")

# List active flows
flows = await client.list_flows()

# Stop a flow instance
await client.stop_flow("flow-123")
```

## Features

- **Flow Classes**: Templates that define workflow structure and interfaces
- **Flow Instances**: Active running workflows based on flow classes
- **Dynamic Management**: Flows can be started/stopped dynamically
- **Template Processing**: Uses template replacement for customizing flow instances
- **Integration**: Works with TrustGraph ecosystem for data processing pipelines
- **Persistent Storage**: Flow definitions and instances stored for reliability

## Use Cases

- **Document Processing**: Orchestrating PDF processing through chunking, extraction, and storage
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Managing workflows for relationship and definition extraction
- **Data Pipelines**: Coordinating complex multi-step data processing workflows
- **Resource Management**: Dynamically scaling processing flows based on demand
